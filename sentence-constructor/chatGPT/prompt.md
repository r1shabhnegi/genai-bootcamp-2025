## Formatting Instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:

- vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and considerations

### Vocabulary Table

- The table should only include verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and nouns.
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table; the student needs to figure out the correct particles to use.
- The table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English.

### Sentence Structure

- Do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- Do not provide tenses and conjugations in the sentence structure
- Remember to consider beginner level sentence structure

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.

- The bird is black. > [Subject] [Adjective].
- The raven is in the garden. > [Location] [Subject] [Verb].
- Put the garbage in the garden. > [Location] [Object] [Verb].
- Did you see the raven? > [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?
- This morning, I saw the raven. > [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].
- Are you going? > [Subject] [Verb]?
- Did you eat the food? > [Object] [Verb]?
  -The raven is looking at the garden. > [Subject] [Verb] [Location].
- The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flower. > [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb].
- I saw the raven beause it was loud. > [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Reason] [Subject] [Verb].

### Clues and considerations

- Try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- Talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the Japanese words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
